# Personal Finance Tracker

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a personal finance tracking app I built to help manage my money better. It's a full-stack application that lets you track expenses, set budgets, and get insights into your spending habits.

## What's Inside

The app is split into two main parts:

- **Backend**: Built with FastAPI, it handles all the data and authentication
- **Frontend**: A React app that makes everything look pretty and easy to use

Here's how everything's organized:

```
personal-finance-tracker/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/                 # The brains of the operation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user_service/       # Handles all the user stuff
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/           # Where the magic happens
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/         # Making sure everything works
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/               # The pretty face
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # All the React components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/            # Static files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml     # Ties everything together
â””â”€â”€ .env.example          # Template for your settings
```
